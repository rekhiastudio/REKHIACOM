        "title": "You position yourselves as a 'Strategic Partner', not just a studio. What's the difference?'?",
        "desc": "The difference is our investment in your business outcome. A typical studio executes a list of tasks. As your Strategic Partner, we start with the 'why'‚Äîyour business goals, your market position, and your user's needs. We contribute ideas, challenge assumptions, and ensure every design and technology decision is aimed at creating a market-defining product. Our success isn't just delivering a project; it's delivering a tangible business asset that drives your growth."
      },
      {
        "title": "What kind of client or project is the best fit for Rekhia?",
        "desc": "We partner best with ambitious founders and established companies who view technology as a core business driver. Our ideal projects are complex digital products, B2B SaaS platforms, and applications where a deep understanding of user experience and robust engineering is critical. We thrive when we can act as a long-term strategic partner, not just a short-term vendor."
      },
      {
        "title": "Why should we choose Rekhia over a larger agency or hiring freelancers?",
        "desc": "We offer the best of both worlds. Unlike large agencies, you get direct access to senior-level architects and avoid layers of bureaucracy. Unlike freelancers, we provide a fully integrated and accountable team covering strategy, design, and engineering under one roof. This unified process eliminates the risks and communication gaps that come with managing a fragmented team."
      },
      {
        "title": "Who will be working on our project?",
        "desc": "Your project will be led and executed by our core team of senior architects and engineers. We do not outsource our primary work or delegate critical thinking to junior staff. You will be collaborating directly with the experts who have the experience to guide your product from strategy to launch and beyond, ensuring the highest quality and consistency."
      },
      {
        "title": "How do you measure the success of a project?",
        "desc": "Success is measured against the business goals we define together in Phase 1. While we track project milestones like delivery dates and budget, our ultimate measures of success are your business outcomes‚Äîsuch as user adoption, conversion rates, customer satisfaction, or operational efficiency. We build products designed to move your metrics."
      },
      {
        "title": "Your 'Rekhia Blueprint' process is very detailed. Why is Phase 1 (Immersion & Strategy) so important?",
        "desc": "The Strategy phase is the single most important factor in a project's success. By investing time upfront to validate assumptions, research the market, and align on goals, we prevent costly mistakes down the line. This phase ensures that the product we build isn't just beautifully designed and well-coded, but that it's also poised for market adoption and business growth."

      {
        "title": "Who owns the intellectual property (IP) of the final product?",
        "desc": "You do. Upon final payment, 100% of the intellectual property, including the source code and design assets, is transferred to you. We retain no ownership of the final work product. Our goal is to build your asset, not ours."

    "items2": [

        "title": "How do you ensure transparency and alignment throughout the project?",
        "desc": "Transparency is at the core of our partnership. We operate in agile sprints with regular live demos where you can see tangible progress. You'll have access to a shared Notion dashboard for tracking tasks and milestones, and a dedicated Discord channel for real-time communication. We treat you as a key member of the project team."
      },
      {
        "title": "What do you need from us during the project?",
        "desc": "We view our clients as partners, and your active participation is key to success. We'll need your timely feedback during review sessions, your expertise on your industry and customers, and a dedicated point of contact from your team to ensure decisions can be made efficiently. The more collaborative our partnership, the better the outcome."
      },
      {
        "title": "What does a typical project investment look like?",
        "desc": "Our partnerships are significant investments in core business assets. While every project is unique, our foundational 'Blueprint' projects typically start in the five-figure range (USD). The final investment depends on the project's complexity, scope, and strategic goals, and is always presented with a clear breakdown of value."
      },
      {
        "title": "How are payments handled for a project?",
        "desc": "For project-based work, we typically follow a milestone-based payment structure (e.g., 40% upfront, 30% at a key milestone, and 30% upon completion). All payments are processed securely through Stripe, allowing you to pay with all major credit cards or via bank transfer. We prioritize security and convenience in all transactions."
      },
      {
        "title": "What happens if our project scope or priorities change mid-project?",
        "desc": "Change is a natural part of product development. Our agile process is designed to accommodate it. If a new priority emerges, we discuss its impact on the timeline and budget with you transparently. We then adjust our sprint planning together to ensure we are always working on what provides the most value to your business."

        "title": "What is your technology philosophy?",
        "desc": "Our philosophy is to use modern, proven, and scalable technologies that ensure your product is fast, reliable, and maintainable for years to come. We specialize in the Next.js and React ecosystem, leveraging platforms like Vercel for world-class performance. We choose tools because they are the right fit for your long-term business objectives."
      },
      {
        "title": "What happens after the product is launched?",
        "desc": "The launch is just the beginning. Our 'Phase 4: Launch & Evolution' is designed to ensure your product thrives. For clients who want a continuous partnership, we offer dedicated 'Growth & Evolution' retainers to keep improving and scaling the product as your business grows, turning it from a project into a permanent asset."
